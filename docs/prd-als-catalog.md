**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** July 28, 2025
**Status:** Backlog Grooming

### 1. Introduction & Mission

To rebuild the ALS Laboratory Product Catalog WordPress plugin using an **agile development methodology**. We will deliver value incrementally, focusing on creating a highly performant, user-friendly, and maintainable product. The primary goal is to improve usability and performance while **preserving all existing functionality and data.**

### 2. Agile Development Approach

This project will be developed using a Scrum framework with the following principles:

* **Sprints:** Work will be organized into 2-week sprints.
* **Sprint Goal:** Each sprint will have a clear, demonstrable goal (e.g., "Complete the product grid view" or "Implement size and color filtering").
* **Continuous Testing:** Every technical task will be accompanied by corresponding unit or integration tests. A task is not considered "done" until its tests are written and passing.
* **Local Prototyping:** The frontend will be prototyped locally using **Firebase Studio**, allowing for rapid UI development and testing before integration with the WordPress backend.
* **CI/CD:** A continuous integration pipeline will run all tests automatically on every new code submission to ensure the main branch is always stable.

### 3. Product Epics & User Stories

Features are defined as high-level **Epics**, which are broken down into smaller, actionable **User Stories**.

#### Epic 1: Product Catalog View
* **As a researcher,** I want to see all products displayed in a clean, responsive grid so I can easily browse the catalog.
* **As a lab manager,** I want to see a high-quality image, name, size, and brief description for each product on its card.
* **As a purchasing agent,** I want to see a badge indicating how many variations (e.g., colors, closures) a product has.

#### Epic 2: Filtering & Search
* **As a lab manager,** I want to quickly filter the product catalog by size, color, and closure type so that I can find the exact product I need.
* **As a researcher,** I want to use a search bar to find products by name.
* **As a user,** I want a simple button to clear all active filters and reset the view.

#### Epic 3: Quote Request System
* **As a purchasing agent,** I want a clear "Request Quote" button on every product card.
* **As a user,** I want the quote form to open in a modal window with the product information already pre-filled.
* **As a site administrator,** I want to receive an email notification and see the new quote saved in the WordPress admin area immediately after a user submits it.

#### Epic 4: Admin Management
* **As a site administrator,** I want an intuitive interface to add, edit, and manage products, variations, and closures.
* **As a site administrator,** I want a dashboard to view, sort, and manage all submitted quotes.

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Security:** All inputs must be sanitized, all requests must use nonces, and user capabilities must be checked.
* **Performance:** The application must utilize caching, optimized asset loading, and efficient data fetching.
